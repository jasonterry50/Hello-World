# Hello-World
I  am new to this programming language. I have just started computer science at 41 years of age. I feel like a d.a. writing about "self". I want to learn as much as i possibly can. I see many a good programmers grace the doors of github and i have come to find out what i can add to my knowledge base. thank you for allowing me.
